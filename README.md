## Purpose
This is a fast-paced quiz to test a user's knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts. 

## How it Works
Users have 5 questions to answer, and a one minute time limit. If a question is answered incorrectly, 20 seconds is deducted from the timer. Each correct answer is worth 20 points. A grade of 60% is required to pass.

## How Its Made
This website is put together mainly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a little bit of jQuery for effect.

## Credits
